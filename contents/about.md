This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self _(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)_. I want to maintain invisibility _(oh really?)_

I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype _(smart ass!)_. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. _(Just hope that they don't read your blogs tushar)_

So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don't want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back _(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)_
