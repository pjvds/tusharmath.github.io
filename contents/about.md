Hi, I am **Tushar Mathur**. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on ```.net``` ```C#``` ```HTML``` ```JavaScript``` ```Node.js``` and ```CoffeeScript```.

*About this blog:* It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off. 

*Right now:* I am working on JavaScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js. I am practicing algorithms and data structures using CoffeeScript since I have lost the touch of it.
