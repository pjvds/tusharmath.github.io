          <section class="content"><p>I tried to copy a lot of biryani recipes that are on the internet and in that process I wasted a lot of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‘s all about the proportions ultimately so don’t take it&nbsp;casually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts for making  mutton dum biryani (<em>same applies for chicken biryani</em>). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<h1>DOs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you use a thick base vessel for cooking so that the heat gets evenly&nbsp;distributed.</li>
<li>Best practice is to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours so that all the juices get inside the&nbsp;meat.</li>
<li>Use lots of fried onions in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>Add good amount of salt. Generally the salt concentration reduces after you add the meat so make sure you have incorporated that in your&nbsp;calculation.</li>
<li>Add good amount of spices, it is possible that the marinade seems spicy at first but trust me on this, after you add the meat the spiciness will decrease&nbsp;considerably.</li>
<li>Cook the meat at the lowest flame that is possible in your kitchen. Low heat helps in uniform&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>Add good amounts of <span class="caps">GHEE</span> (<em>clarified butter</em>) in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>The rice used should be of high quality&nbsp;basmati.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel so that the heat doesn&#39;t&nbsp;escape.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don‘t use too much of curd, it makes the meat bland and tasteless. It only helps in cooking, it does’t add any taste to the&nbsp;biryani.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t give direct heat to the meat, put the vessel over a pan or some other metal layer (<em>Heat should be transferred to the vessel through conduction and not convection</em>). It takes time to cook, mutton might take upto 1:45 hrs to cook and chicken can take upto 1:15 hrs. So have&nbsp;patience.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t add raw onions in the marinade, it will not taste&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>

        <section class="about"><p>Hi, I am <strong>Tushar Mathur</strong>. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on <code>.net</code> <code>C#</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>JavaScript</code> <code>Node.js</code> and <code>CoffeeScript</code>.</p>
<p><em>About this blog:</em> It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off. </p>
<p><em>Right now:</em> I am working on JavaScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js. I am practicing algorithms and data structures using CoffeeScript since I have lost the touch of it.</p>
