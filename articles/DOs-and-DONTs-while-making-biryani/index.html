          <section class="content"><p>I tried to copy a lot of biryani recipes that are on the internet and in that process I wasted a lot of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‘s all about the proportions ultimately so don’t take it&nbsp;casually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts for making  mutton dum biryani (<em>same applies for chicken biryani</em>). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<h1>DOs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you use a thick base vessel for cooking so that the heat gets evenly&nbsp;distributed.</li>
<li>Best practice is to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours so that all the juices get inside the&nbsp;meat.</li>
<li>Use lots of fried onions in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>Add good amount of salt. Generally the salt concentration reduces after you add the meat so make sure you have incorporated that in your&nbsp;calculation.</li>
<li>Add good amount of spices, it is possible that the marinade seems spicy at first but trust me on this, after you add the meat the spiciness will decrease&nbsp;considerably.</li>
<li>Cook the meat at the lowest flame that is possible in your kitchen. Low heat helps in uniform&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>Add good amounts of <span class="caps">GHEE</span> (<em>clarified butter</em>) in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>The rice used should be of high quality&nbsp;basmati.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel so that the heat doesn&#39;t&nbsp;escape.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don‘t use too much of curd, it makes the meat bland and tasteless. It only helps in cooking, it does’t add any taste to the&nbsp;biryani.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t give direct heat to the meat, put the vessel over a pan or some other metal layer (<em>Heat should be transferred to the vessel through conduction and not convection</em>). It takes time to cook, mutton might take upto 1:45 hrs to cook and chicken can take upto 1:15 hrs. So have&nbsp;patience.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t add raw onions in the marinade, it will not taste&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>

        <section class="about"><p>This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self <em>(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)</em>. I want to maintain invisibility <em>(oh really?)</em></p>
<p>I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype <em>(smart ass!)</em>. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. <em>(Just hope that they don&#39;t read your blogs tushar)</em></p>
<p>So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don&#39;t want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back <em>(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)</em></p>
