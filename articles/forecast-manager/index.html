          <section class="content"><p>Forecast Manager was my second project in <a href="http://zsassociates.com/"><span class="caps">Z.S.</span> Associates</a>. It was a <span class="caps">MVC</span> .Net based web application that would help in maintaining forecasting models. These models were designed in MS Excel and could be merged with each other and to create different versions. The application could also render reports on the web and could help in managing access rights in an extremely customized way per user and per client&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>The team size was very dynamic but I was the oldest member of the team and knew the inside out of the web application. As a developer I had two&nbsp;roles- </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design and develop features:</strong> I had to convert business needs into technical requirements and research on each feature throughout the full software development cycle. <em>I worked on multiple features which I will list later</em>. Development was done in C# mainly. On the <span class="caps">UI</span> side we used knockout.js and jQuery to maintain a MVVM design pattern. On the database side we used Entity Framework as an ORM on top of SQL Server&nbsp;2006.</li>
<li><strong>Automate the deployment process:</strong> I developed Powershell scripts to be executed on Teamcity so as to automate the process of deployment which effectively reduced the deployment time by 98.7%. Since we had around fifty instances of the application and upgrading all of them in one go would take a lot of time more over we had the overhead of maintaing multiple webconfigs which had to be manually modified every time we upgraded, as all the customizations per client we set in the web.config file. Even our tag creation was not automated initially and since our teams were so dispersed geographically it was very difficult to share signed releases. With all the automation scripts in place we saved around eight man hours&nbsp;weekly.</li>

        <section class="about"><p>This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self <em>(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)</em>. I want to maintain invisibility <em>(oh really?)</em></p>
<p>I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype <em>(smart ass!)</em>. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. <em>(Just hope that they don&#39;t read your blogs tushar)</em></p>
<p>So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don&#39;t want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back <em>(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)</em></p>
