          <section class="content"><p>These are my personal notes from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do">David Flanagan&#39;s Javascript the Definitive Guide</a>. I though I will share them with everyone in terms of a <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> format. I will cover each chapter one by one but since Chapter 1 and 2 are very basic I have started with chapter three. If I get time I will put questions from Chapter 2 as well. Please note that these are my own notes and it is possible that I might have not explained certain concepts in great detail. In case you have more doubts about a question post it in the comments section or refer to the amazing book for more&nbsp;details.</p>
<p><em>Trust me on this, if you go through these questions diligently one chapter per day then in twenty two days there will be no interview that you can not crack&nbsp;:)</em> </p>

        <section class="about"><p>Hi, I am <strong>Tushar Mathur</strong>. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on <code>.net</code> <code>C#</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>JavaScript</code> <code>Node.js</code> and <code>CoffeeScript</code>.</p>
<p><em>About this blog:</em> It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off. </p>
<p><em>Right now:</em> I am working on JavaScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js. I am practicing algorithms and data structures using CoffeeScript since I have lost the touch of it.</p>
