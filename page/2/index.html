            <h2><a href="/articles/why-i-dont-like-cricket/">Why I don't like cricket?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Cricket is a very popular sport here in India. Even though Hockey is our national game, cricket is more followed and idolized. People are so sentimental about cricket that they don‘t go to offices, in fact some private companies have half days or sometimes full day off when India is playing. People literally go crazy when India has a match with Pakisthan - a country with whom we have had three wars in the past. I don’t have the exact figures but I am pretty sure that the matches have always militated against India&#39;s <span class="caps">GDP</span> for that particular day&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>My grandfather was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy">Ranji</a> player and my mother was in the state cricket team representing Rajasthan. Yet I was not that great in cricket, in fact I was bad, really really bad. I was bad in Basketball and Football too and now when I see this pattern it seems like I was bad in every team sport, probably I am not a team player <em>(more about that later)</em>. I wasn&#39;t bad in badminton, squash and swimming, I loved games where I could perform by my self which is a typical characteristic of an introvert when I had my last introspection <em>(by the way introverts are not shy people, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4">this</a>)</em></p>
<p>What I am about to say now might offend a lot of people and the only follower of this blog <em>(My Mother)</em>. So mom I think that out of the twenty two players in a game of cricket, at a particular instance of time effectively less than 60% players are playing - rest are not even on the ground. Taking a one day match for example - there are 50 overs, which means around 300 balls. If the shots are played in such a way that every fielder gets a fair chance to field then each fielder gets 30 shots to save (300/10, excluding the bowler). A single session would last for around 3 hours <em>(10800 seconds)</em>. An average shot takes round about 8 seconds, this is the time that it takes for the ball to hit the bat, saved by the fielder and back to either the bowler or the keeper. So effectively a fielder plays for around 2.2% (30*8/10800) of the game time. In the whole game the players are not playing for more than 97% of the time. Interestingly in other sports the players can run behind the balls as it travels at much lower speeds, on the other hand in cricket the ball is much smaller, travels faster and you have to catch it with your bare hands. Ultimately the fielder has to wait for the ball to slow down and come into his&nbsp;hands.</p>
<p><em>Ok, so fielding isn&#39;t that exciting I get it but what about batting?</em> As far as batting is concerned I agree that the players do spend a decent amount of energy trying to hit the ball and take runs. Even so - what would happen if all the runs are scored by just two top batsmen? Others don&#39;t get to play which is one of the reasons I never got a chance to bat much :(
But again batting is more based on technique and less based on strength. Practically it is not possible to predict the path of the ball in such a short duration of time. The batsman can only anticipate the path of the ball and take a chance by positioning their bats in a way they feel will be appropriate. Which is good for them because now if they get out they have no reason to blame themselves for not hitting the ball properly because its technically impossible for the human nervous system to work at such a&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>People still love cricket and I am getting bored because I can‘t watch my favorite programs on the discovery channel. <span class="caps">IPL</span> was streamed on TV for two months and now its the challenger cup. I can’t seem to understand why people don&#39;t get bored with cricket. Veritasium2 has a theory about it, check it out&nbsp;-</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/DOs-and-DONTs-while-making-biryani/">DOs and DON'Ts while making biryani</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I tried to copy a lot of biryani recipes that are on the internet and in that process I wasted a lot of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‘s all about the proportions ultimately so don’t take it&nbsp;casually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts for making  mutton dum biryani (<em>same applies for chicken biryani</em>). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<h1>DOs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you use a thick base vessel for cooking so that the heat gets evenly&nbsp;distributed.</li>
<li>Best practice is to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours so that all the juices get inside the&nbsp;meat.</li>
<li>Use lots of fried onions in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>Add good amount of salt. Generally the salt concentration reduces after you add the meat so make sure you have incorporated that in your&nbsp;calculation.</li>
<li>Add good amount of spices, it is possible that the marinade seems spicy at first but trust me on this, after you add the meat the spiciness will decrease&nbsp;considerably.</li>
<li>Cook the meat at the lowest flame that is possible in your kitchen. Low heat helps in uniform&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>Add good amounts of <span class="caps">GHEE</span> (<em>clarified butter</em>) in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>The rice used should be of high quality&nbsp;basmati.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel so that the heat doesn&#39;t&nbsp;escape.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don‘t use too much of curd, it makes the meat bland and tasteless. It only helps in cooking, it does’t add any taste to the&nbsp;biryani.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t give direct heat to the meat, put the vessel over a pan or some other metal layer (<em>Heat should be transferred to the vessel through conduction and not convection</em>). It takes time to cook, mutton might take upto 1:45 hrs to cook and chicken can take upto 1:15 hrs. So have&nbsp;patience.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t add raw onions in the marinade, it will not taste&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>

          <section class="content"><p>If you are one of those people who keep sweating or have an abnormally high sensitivity towards heat then you are going to benefit from this blog. The idea is to keep your body cool and here are some tips and some science related to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to understand that hotness and high temperature are two different things. You may be feeling hot but its not always because the temperature is high. Our sensory system reacts to temperature by calculating the rate at which heat energy is gained or lost from the body. The following minute physics video elaborates on this&nbsp;concept.</p>
<iframe class='youtube' src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yXT012us9ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  


<p>Your sweat contains urea, minerals, lactate and water. When you get into a cool environment after sweating, the water effectively evaporates not because its cooler but because now there is less perspiration compared to evaporation. So your body dries up leaving behind only the urea, minerals and lactate on the epidermis. Since they are pretty bad conductors of heat even though you are in a cool environment you still feel warm because your sensory system is kind of insulated with these sweat residuals. Thus its a cycle- you sweat once and then you keep on sweating because you can&#39;t feel the coolness. The solution is to try to not sweat at all in the first place or take frequent baths so that you clear up your sweat residual from the&nbsp;epidermis.</p>
<p>I know this methodology of <em>try not to sweat</em> and <em>take frequent baths</em> is banal but its effective and I have only explained the science behind it. Hope this keeps you cool this&nbsp;summer!</p>

<p><em>About this blog:</em> It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off. </p>
<p><em>Right now:</em> I am working on JavaScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js. I am practicing algorithms and data structures using CoffeeScript since I have lost the touch of it.</p>
