            <h2><a href="/articles/why-i-dont-like-cricket/">Why I don't like cricket?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Cricket is a very popular sport here in India. Even though Hockey is our national game, cricket is more followed and idolized. People are so sentimental about cricket that they don‘t go to offices, in fact some private companies have half days or sometimes full day off when India is playing. People literally go crazy when India has a match with Pakisthan - a country with whom we have had three wars in the past. I don’t have the exact figures but I am pretty sure that the matches have always militated against India&#39;s <span class="caps">GDP</span> for that particular day&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>My grandfather was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy">Ranji</a> player and my mother was in the state cricket team representing Rajasthan. Yet I was not that great in cricket, in fact I was bad, really really bad. I was bad in Basketball and Football too and now when I see this pattern it seems like I was bad in every team sport, probably I am not a team player <em>(more about that later)</em>. I wasn&#39;t bad in badminton, squash and swimming, I loved games where I could perform by my self which is a typical characteristic of an introvert when I had my last introspection <em>(by the way introverts are not shy people, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4">this</a>)</em></p>
<p>What I am about to say now might offend a lot of people and the only follower of this blog <em>(My Mother)</em>. So mom I think that out of the twenty two players in a game of cricket, at a particular instance of time effectively less than 60% players are playing - rest are not even on the ground. Taking a one day match for example - there are 50 overs, which means around 300 balls. If the shots are played in such a way that every fielder gets a fair chance to field then each fielder gets 30 shots to save (300/10, excluding the bowler). A single session would last for around 3 hours <em>(10800 seconds)</em>. An average shot takes round about 8 seconds, this is the time that it takes for the ball to hit the bat, saved by the fielder and back to either the bowler or the keeper. So effectively a fielder plays for around 2.2% (30*8/10800) of the game time. In the whole game the players are not playing for more than 97% of the time. Interestingly in other sports the players can run behind the balls as it travels at much lower speeds, on the other hand in cricket the ball is much smaller, travels faster and you have to catch it with your bare hands. Ultimately the fielder has to wait for the ball to slow down and come into his&nbsp;hands.</p>
<p><em>Ok, so fielding isn&#39;t that exciting I get it but what about batting?</em> As far as batting is concerned I agree that the players do spend a decent amount of energy trying to hit the ball and take runs. Even so - what would happen if all the runs are scored by just two top batsmen? Others don&#39;t get to play which is one of the reasons I never got a chance to bat much :(
But again batting is more based on technique and less based on strength. Practically it is not possible to predict the path of the ball in such a short duration of time. The batsman can only anticipate the path of the ball and take a chance by positioning their bats in a way they feel will be appropriate. Which is good for them because now if they get out they have no reason to blame themselves for not hitting the ball properly because its technically impossible for the human nervous system to work at such a&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>People still love cricket and I am getting bored because I can‘t watch my favorite programs on the discovery channel. <span class="caps">IPL</span> was streamed on TV for two months and now its the challenger cup. I can’t seem to understand why people don&#39;t get bored with cricket. Veritasium2 has a theory about it, check it out&nbsp;-</p>

          <section class="content"><p>If you are one of those people who keep sweating or have an abnormally high sensitivity towards heat then you are going to benefit from this blog. The idea is to keep your body cool and here are some tips and some science related to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to understand that hotness and high temperature are two different things. You may be feeling hot but its not always because the temperature is high. Our sensory system reacts to temperature by calculating the rate at which heat energy is gained or lost from the body. The following minute physics video elaborates on this&nbsp;concept.</p>
<iframe class='youtube' src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yXT012us9ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  


<p>Your sweat contains urea, minerals, lactate and water. When you get into a cool environment after sweating, the water effectively evaporates not because its cooler but because now there is less perspiration compared to evaporation. So your body dries up leaving behind only the urea, minerals and lactate on the epidermis. Since they are pretty bad conductors of heat even though you are in a cool environment you still feel warm because your sensory system is kind of insulated with these sweat residuals. Thus its a cycle- you sweat once and then you keep on sweating because you can&#39;t feel the coolness. The solution is to try to not sweat at all in the first place or take frequent baths so that you clear up your sweat residual from the&nbsp;epidermis.</p>
<p>I know this methodology of <em>try not to sweat</em> and <em>take frequent baths</em> is banal but its effective and I have only explained the science behind it. Hope this keeps you cool this&nbsp;summer!</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/driving-at-night/">Misconceptions about driving at night</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The most common misconception that people have about driving at night is&nbsp;- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chances of having an accident increase with decrease in intensity of&nbsp;light</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So do you really think so? May be, may be not. The thing is that everybody knows the disadvantages of driving at night but no one really pays attention to the advantages of night&nbsp;driving.</p>
<p>I would first like to talk about the different light intensities during&nbsp;twilight.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First case is the one in which the darkness is subjective to your sensitivity and to your orientation with respect to the sun. So some people would have their head lights switched on and some would have them off. This is a little risky <em>(understating really)</em>  because not all people have their lights on, your eyes can only see those people who have their lights on, so you are blinded by those lights now and people with their lights switched off will not be visible. That&#39;s the same reason for not being able to see the stars in the day&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second stage is much better - now its dark for everyone on the road and everyone have their lights on. So you are seeing more people effectively in comparison to the case&nbsp;one. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the two cases which depict different visibility conditions in a matter of just 15-20&nbsp;mins.</p>
<p>Now coming back to the main point which is - Is driving at night really that&nbsp;bad?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The thing is that when you are driving in the day time you are not able to communicate with the person driving in front of you. You can honk but its possible that he doesn&#39;t hear you. So basically  the driver in front you is not aware of the fact that you are driving behind him. At night its different you can give a high-low beam pass to the driver which will notify him that you are close to him and he should not change lanes randomly. In pure statistical sense the information for the driver about his surroundings have&nbsp;doubled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At night the visibility of a car on the road increases because now a car&#39;s position is determined by its tail lights in contrast to the daytime when its the car itself. <em>How is it better?</em> It&#39;s better because at night the contrast is much more, you are seeing a bright light in a black background. <em>But what about everything that is not glowing?</em> Good question! Actually this is where having some traffic on the road actually helps. If the car a moving in front of you, you can quite essentially assume that the distance between you and that car is clean and safe to drive because the car in front of you just travelled that distance. So you can without worrying travel that distance at a higher speed than the car in front of you. But wait now you have over taken that car and there is another car in front of you right? Apply the same logic on that car also and you will be able to drive at a speed which is greater than the average speed of the&nbsp;traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have guessed it by now that all the conclusions are based on a single and a very important assumption which is &gt; there is traffic on the road. <em>So what happens when you have traffic in the day time, shouldn&#39;t I be able to drive at the same speed?</em> Yes, that&#39;s why I said its not worse if not better. The thinking&nbsp;that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are limited to a max of up to hundred meters depending on the range of your head&nbsp;lights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is obviously not true! As we learnt in the second point that you can use the information which has been used by the car moving in front of&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>So is it really better or almost the same? Well, if I get some time later I would love to do some mathematics to prove that its safer to drive at night. For now at least I am not biased about day being safer to&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p><em>I can still write a lot about it, I need to end this post&nbsp;now</em></p>

        <section class="about"><p>This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self <em>(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)</em>. I want to maintain invisibility <em>(oh really?)</em></p>
<p>I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype <em>(smart ass!)</em>. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. <em>(Just hope that they don&#39;t read your blogs tushar)</em></p>
<p>So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don&#39;t want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back <em>(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)</em></p>
