            <h2><a href="/articles/driving-at-night/">Misconceptions about driving at night</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The most common misconception that people have about driving at night is&nbsp;- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chances of having an accident increase with decrease in intensity of&nbsp;light</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So do you really think so? May be, may be not. The thing is that everybody knows the disadvantages of driving at night but no one really pays attention to the advantages of night&nbsp;driving.</p>
<p>I would first like to talk about the different light intensities during&nbsp;twilight.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First case is the one in which the darkness is subjective to your sensitivity and to your orientation with respect to the sun. So some people would have their head lights switched on and some would have them off. This is a little risky <em>(understating really)</em>  because not all people have their lights on, your eyes can only see those people who have their lights on, so you are blinded by those lights now and people with their lights switched off will not be visible. That&#39;s the same reason for not being able to see the stars in the day&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second stage is much better - now its dark for everyone on the road and everyone have their lights on. So you are seeing more people effectively in comparison to the case&nbsp;one. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the two cases which depict different visibility conditions in a matter of just 15-20&nbsp;mins.</p>
<p>Now coming back to the main point which is - Is driving at night really that&nbsp;bad?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The thing is that when you are driving in the day time you are not able to communicate with the person driving in front of you. You can honk but its possible that he doesn&#39;t hear you. So basically  the driver in front you is not aware of the fact that you are driving behind him. At night its different you can give a high-low beam pass to the driver which will notify him that you are close to him and he should not change lanes randomly. In pure statistical sense the information for the driver about his surroundings have&nbsp;doubled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At night the visibility of a car on the road increases because now a car&#39;s position is determined by its tail lights in contrast to the daytime when its the car itself. <em>How is it better?</em> It&#39;s better because at night the contrast is much more, you are seeing a bright light in a black background. <em>But what about everything that is not glowing?</em> Good question! Actually this is where having some traffic on the road actually helps. If the car a moving in front of you, you can quite essentially assume that the distance between you and that car is clean and safe to drive because the car in front of you just travelled that distance. So you can without worrying travel that distance at a higher speed than the car in front of you. But wait now you have over taken that car and there is another car in front of you right? Apply the same logic on that car also and you will be able to drive at a speed which is greater than the average speed of the&nbsp;traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have guessed it by now that all the conclusions are based on a single and a very important assumption which is &gt; there is traffic on the road. <em>So what happens when you have traffic in the day time, shouldn&#39;t I be able to drive at the same speed?</em> Yes, that&#39;s why I said its not worse if not better. The thinking&nbsp;that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are limited to a max of up to hundred meters depending on the range of your head&nbsp;lights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is obviously not true! As we learnt in the second point that you can use the information which has been used by the car moving in front of&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>So is it really better or almost the same? Well, if I get some time later I would love to do some mathematics to prove that its safer to drive at night. For now at least I am not biased about day being safer to&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p><em>I can still write a lot about it, I need to end this post&nbsp;now</em></p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/forecast-manager/">Javelin Forecast Manager</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Forecast Manager was my second project in <a href="http://zsassociates.com/"><span class="caps">Z.S.</span> Associates</a>. It was a <span class="caps">MVC</span> .Net based web application that would help in maintaining forecasting models. These models were designed in MS Excel and could be merged with each other and to create different versions. The application could also render reports on the web and could help in managing access rights in an extremely customized way per user and per client&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>The team size was very dynamic but I was the oldest member of the team and knew the inside out of the web application. As a developer I had two&nbsp;roles- </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design and develop features:</strong> I had to convert business needs into technical requirements and research on each feature throughout the full software development cycle. <em>I worked on multiple features which I will list later</em>. Development was done in C# mainly. On the <span class="caps">UI</span> side we used knockout.js and jQuery to maintain a MVVM design pattern. On the database side we used Entity Framework as an ORM on top of SQL Server&nbsp;2006.</li>
<li><strong>Automate the deployment process:</strong> I developed Powershell scripts to be executed on Teamcity so as to automate the process of deployment which effectively reduced the deployment time by 98.7%. Since we had around fifty instances of the application and upgrading all of them in one go would take a lot of time more over we had the overhead of maintaing multiple webconfigs which had to be manually modified every time we upgraded, as all the customizations per client we set in the web.config file. Even our tag creation was not automated initially and since our teams were so dispersed geographically it was very difficult to share signed releases. With all the automation scripts in place we saved around eight man hours&nbsp;weekly.</li>
</ol>

        <section class="about"><p>This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self <em>(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)</em>. I want to maintain invisibility <em>(oh really?)</em></p>
<p>I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype <em>(smart ass!)</em>. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. <em>(Just hope that they don&#39;t read your blogs tushar)</em></p>
<p>So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don&#39;t want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back <em>(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)</em></p>
