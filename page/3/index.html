            <h2><a href="/articles/forecast-manager/">Javelin Forecast Manager</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Forecast Manager was my second project in <a href="http://zsassociates.com/"><span class="caps">Z.S.</span> Associates</a>. It was a <span class="caps">MVC</span> .Net based web application that would help in maintaining forecasting models. These models were designed in MS Excel and could be merged with each other and to create different versions. The application could also render reports on the web and could help in managing access rights in an extremely customized way per user and per client&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>The team size was very dynamic but I was the oldest member of the team and knew the inside out of the web application. As a developer I had two&nbsp;roles- </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design and develop features:</strong> I had to convert business needs into technical requirements and research on each feature throughout the full software development cycle. <em>I worked on multiple features which I will list later</em>. Development was done in C# mainly. On the <span class="caps">UI</span> side we used knockout.js and jQuery to maintain a MVVM design pattern. On the database side we used Entity Framework as an ORM on top of SQL Server&nbsp;2006.</li>
<li><strong>Automate the deployment process:</strong> I developed Powershell scripts to be executed on Teamcity so as to automate the process of deployment which effectively reduced the deployment time by 98.7%. Since we had around fifty instances of the application and upgrading all of them in one go would take a lot of time more over we had the overhead of maintaing multiple webconfigs which had to be manually modified every time we upgraded, as all the customizations per client we set in the web.config file. Even our tag creation was not automated initially and since our teams were so dispersed geographically it was very difficult to share signed releases. With all the automation scripts in place we saved around eight man hours&nbsp;weekly.</li>
</ol>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Data Integration was my first project in <a href="http://zsassociates.com/"><span class="caps">Z.S.</span> Associates</a>. Our aim was to study and create POCs on various data integration tools. My role was to evaluate <a href="http://www.boomi.com/">Boomi</a> and <a href="http://integration.pervasive.com/">Pervasive</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Created various types of POCs with each of the <span class="caps">DI</span> tools which would perform data integration between multiple applications such as Salesforce, Javelin Routing Manager, Javelin Call Plan Manager and Javelin Data&nbsp;Manager.</li>
<li>Reported a major bug in Boomi while evaluating&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Concluded that Boomi was the best data integration tool which suited <span class="caps">ZS</span>’s&nbsp;needs.</li>
<li>Trained the consulting team in <span class="caps">ZS</span> on how to use&nbsp;Boomi.</li>

        <section class="about"><p>Hi, I am <strong>Tushar Mathur</strong>. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on .net, c#, Html, Javascript and node.js.</p>
<p>About this blog - It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off.</p>
