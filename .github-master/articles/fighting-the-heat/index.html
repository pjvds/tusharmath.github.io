          <section class="content"><p>If you are one of those people who keep sweating or have an abnormally high sensitivity towards heat then you are going to benefit from this blog. The idea is to keep your body cool and here are some tips and some science related to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to understand that hotness and high temperature are two different things. You may be feeling hot but its not always because the temperature is high. Our sensory system reacts to temperature by calculating the rate at which heat energy is gained or lost from the body. The following minute physics video elaborates on this&nbsp;concept.</p>

<p>Your sweat contains urea, minerals, lactate and water. When you get into a cool environment after sweating, the water effectively evaporates not because its cooler but because now there is less perspiration compared to evaporation. So your body dries up leaving behind only the urea, minerals and lactate on the epidermis. Since they are pretty bad conductors of heat even though you are in a cool environment you still feel warm because your sensory system is kind of insulated with these sweat residuals. Thus its a cycle- you sweat once and then you keep on sweating because you can&#39;t feel the coolness. The solution is to try to not sweat at all in the first place or take frequent baths so that you clear up your sweat residual from the&nbsp;epidermis.</p>
<p>I know this methodology of <em>try not to sweat</em> and <em>take frequent baths</em> is banal but its effective and I have only explained the science behind it. Hope this keeps you cool this&nbsp;summer!</p>

        <section class="about"><p>Hi, I am <strong>Tushar Mathur</strong>. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on .net, c#, Html, Javascript and node.js.</p>
<p>About this blog - It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off.</p>
