          <section class="content"><p>Data Integration was my first project in <a href="http://zsassociates.com/"><span class="caps">Z.S.</span> Associates</a>. Our aim was to study and create POCs on various data integration tools. My role was to evaluate <a href="http://www.boomi.com/">Boomi</a> and <a href="http://integration.pervasive.com/">Pervasive</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Created various types of POCs with each of the <span class="caps">DI</span> tools which would perform data integration between multiple applications such as Salesforce, Javelin Routing Manager, Javelin Call Plan Manager and Javelin Data&nbsp;Manager.</li>
<li>Reported a major bug in Boomi while evaluating&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Concluded that Boomi was the best data integration tool which suited <span class="caps">ZS</span>’s&nbsp;needs.</li>
<li>Trained the consulting team in <span class="caps">ZS</span> on how to use&nbsp;Boomi.</li>
</ul>

        <section class="about"><p>Hi, I am <strong>Tushar Mathur</strong>. I am a software engineer. I see software as something which can help people in making their lives easier. Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on .net, c#, Html, Javascript and node.js.</p>
<p>About this blog - It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off.</p>
