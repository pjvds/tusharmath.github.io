            <h2><a href="/articles/mt-downloader/">Node.js Mt Downloader</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Why would someone want a <strong>multi threaded downloader</strong>? Well, the answer is quite simple - To increase download&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>What it really does is, it makes multiple connections with the server from where the file has to be downloaded. Now since data is sent in packets on those connections. There is always little bit of a lag between these packets. This especially happens if you have a low speed internet connection or there are multiple applications using the internet at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>When you make multiple connections you minimize that lag period because at any given instance there is at least one thread which is delivering a packet of data. This helps in efficient use of the bandwidth. You won&#39;t get a speed more than that allotted by your <span class="caps">ISP</span> using this&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>There are quite a few multi threaded downloaders such as <a href="http://dfast.sourceforge.net/">wxDownload</a> and <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33754/progressive-downloader">Progressive Downloader</a> but they din&#39;t really have the flexibility that I wanted in my downloader. I needed something more than just a simple multi threaded downloader. I needed something which could let me stop and resume downloads from the last downloaded byte even if I restarted my computer. There were some downloaders which had these features but I also wanted something which had an api and could be used with my other&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>So I created this node.js based http-downloader - <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/Multi-threaded-downloader">mt-downloader</a>. One very important reason for making this was that I also wanted to learn <strong>node.js</strong> and <strong>improve my javascript skills</strong> which I did&nbsp;eventually. </p>
<p>Once the library was completed I also created a thin console based wrapper around it and called it <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/mtd-console">mt-console</a>. This is what I use for my downloads&nbsp;now.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/win7-on-retina-disply-with-virtual-box/">How to configure windows on Mac (retina) using virtual box</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>You don&#39;t have any money left to buy Parallels or Fusion so you are stuck up with Virtual box for the time being. Virtual box unfortunately does not provide a support for retina displays (At the time of writing this&nbsp;document).</p>
<p>You will keep trying out different resolutions and will still not be satisfied because sometimes the content would be too stretched in the horizontal direction and sometimes in the vertical direction. You might then have to use a really low resolution which would look and feel pathetic&nbsp;!</p>
<p>So here are some steps that you could try out to improve your user experience with Virtual Box till the time they don&#39;t provide you with actual retina&nbsp;support.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong>
Determine the number of pixels on your screen. For e.g.- Mac pro 13“ and 15” Retina have 2560 by 1600&nbsp;pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>
The <span class="caps">VM</span> will respect the resolutions properly only in Scale mode. In scale mode the VM is viewed in a window. A window will not take-up the complete screen. So you need to get the maximum size that a window can take up on your screen (Without going into fullscreen&nbsp;mode). </p>
<p>What I really mean by that statement is - out of the 2560x1400 px of real estate available on the screen only 2560x700 px can be used by a window to show content. Why ? Because I have a dock at the bottom and a menu bar at the top which takes up some space vertically. So in this step you need to calculate that space. Here is how I did&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I personally used the <strong>⌘ + ⇧ + 4</strong> button to take a snapshot of the window and then see the resolution of the image file. So in my particular case I have the dock in the bottom so I need to compromise the height of the screen. Rounding off to the nearest integer the available real estate of a window comes out to be&nbsp;2560x1400.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>
Now you need to setup this custom resolution on your <span class="caps">VM</span>. So keep the VM on and run the following command on your&nbsp;terminal</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ VBoxManage controlvm [VM name] setvideomodehint [Width] [Height] 32</code></pre>
<p>For e.g. if you want to try this on a mac pro 13&quot;&nbsp;retina</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ VBoxManage controlvm Win7 setvideomodehint 2560 1400 32</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong>
This would be a really high resolution and you will not be able to read anything on the <span class="caps">VM</span> because the text would be really small. So now go to your VM with win7 installed and follow these steps&nbsp;- </p>
<ol>
<li>Open display&nbsp;settings.</li>
<li>Click on [Set custom size <span class="caps">DPI</span>] from the right hand side Navigation&nbsp;Bar.</li>
<li>Scale the font size to&nbsp;200%.</li>
<li>Click ok, Log off and Login&nbsp;again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila! you will definitely have a better Win7 experience on Mac&nbsp;now.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/DOs-and-DONTs-while-making-biryani/">DOs and DON'Ts while making biryani</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I tried to copy a lot of biryani recipes that are on the internet and in that process I wasted a lot of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‘s all about the proportions ultimately so don’t take it&nbsp;casually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts for making  mutton dum biryani (<em>same applies for chicken biryani</em>). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<h1>DOs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you use a thick base vessel for cooking so that the heat gets evenly&nbsp;distributed.</li>
<li>Best practice is to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours so that all the juices get inside the&nbsp;meat.</li>
<li>Use lots of fried onions in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>Add good amount of salt. Generally the salt concentration reduces after you add the meat so make sure you have incorporated that in your&nbsp;calculation.</li>
<li>Add good amount of spices, it is possible that the marinade seems spicy at first but trust me on this, after you add the meat the spiciness will decrease&nbsp;considerably.</li>
<li>Cook the meat at the lowest flame that is possible in your kitchen. Low heat helps in uniform&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>Add good amounts of <span class="caps">GHEE</span> (<em>clarified butter</em>) in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>The rice used should be of high quality&nbsp;basmati.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel so that the heat doesn&#39;t&nbsp;escape.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don‘t use too much of curd, it makes the meat bland and tasteless. It only helps in cooking, it does’t add any taste to the&nbsp;biryani.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t give direct heat to the meat, put the vessel over a pan or some other metal layer (<em>Heat should be transferred to the vessel through conduction and not convection</em>). It takes time to cook, mutton might take upto 1:45 hrs to cook and chicken can take upto 1:15 hrs. So have&nbsp;patience.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t add raw onions in the marinade, it will not taste&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>

        <section class="about"><p>This is not a technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self <em>(why the hell is it on a public domain then?)</em>. I want to maintain invisibility <em>(oh really?)</em></p>
<p>I feel even though I am on a public domain, people wont be knowing about it so no one would even think about coming here to see whats going on, instead they will see my facebook page, twitter or may be try to hack into my email accounts. Its a reverse psychology archetype <em>(smart ass!)</em>. Something like  this - you put your keys in the car and keep it running so that the potential thieves think that you are around cause obviously no one is that silly, thus keep your car safe. <em>(Just hope that they don&#39;t read your blogs tushar)</em></p>
<p>So what should you be expecting over here? You should be expecting psychological observations, social observations, some science observations, may be some technical stuff, probably some reviews. I might post some information about my own projects or something that I am proud of. I don&#39;t want comments on my blog but you can always email me at tusharmath@gmail.com with your feed back <em>(dude what happened to your invisibility funda?)</em></p>
