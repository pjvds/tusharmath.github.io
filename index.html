            <h2><a href="/articles/mt-downloader/">Node.js Mt Downloader</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Why would someone want a <strong>multi threaded downloader</strong>? Well, the answer is quite simple - To increase download&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>What it really does is, it makes multiple connections with the server from where the file has to be downloaded. Now since data is sent in packets on those connections. There is always little bit of a lag between these packets. This especially happens if you have a low speed internet connection or there are multiple applications using the internet at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>When you make multiple connections you minimize that lag period because at any given instance there is at least one thread which is delivering a packet of data. This helps in efficient use of the bandwidth. You won&#39;t get a speed more than that allotted by your <span class="caps">ISP</span> using this&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>There are quite a few multi threaded downloaders such as <a href="http://dfast.sourceforge.net/">wxDownload</a> and <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33754/progressive-downloader">Progressive Downloader</a> but they din&#39;t really have the flexibility that I wanted in my downloader. I needed something more than just a simple multi threaded downloader. I needed something which could let me stop and resume downloads from the last downloaded byte even if I restarted my computer. There were some downloaders which had these features but I also wanted something which had an api and could be used with my other&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>So I created this node.js based http-downloader - <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/Multi-threaded-downloader">mt-downloader</a>. One very important reason for making this was that I also wanted to learn <strong>node.js</strong> and <strong>improve my javascript skills</strong> which I did&nbsp;eventually. </p>
<p>Once the library was completed I also created a thin console based wrapper around it and called it <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/mtd-console">mt-console</a>. This is what I use for my downloads&nbsp;now.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/win7-on-retina-display-with-virtual-box/">How to configure windows on Mac (retina) using virtual box</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>You don&#39;t have any money left to buy Parallels or Fusion so you are stuck up with Virtual box for the time being. Virtual box unfortunately does not provide a support for retina displays (At the time of writing this&nbsp;document).</p>
<p>You will keep trying out different resolutions and will still not be satisfied because sometimes the content would be too stretched in the horizontal direction and sometimes in the vertical direction. You might then have to use a really low resolution which would look and feel pathetic&nbsp;!</p>
<p>So here are some steps that you could try out to improve your user experience with Virtual Box till the time they don&#39;t provide you with actual retina&nbsp;support.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong>
Determine the number of pixels on your screen. For e.g.- Mac pro 13“ and 15” Retina have 2560 by 1600&nbsp;pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>
The <span class="caps">VM</span> will respect the resolutions properly only in Scale mode. In scale mode the VM is viewed in a window. A window will not take-up the complete screen. So you need to get the maximum size that a window can take up on your screen (Without going into fullscreen&nbsp;mode). </p>
<p>What I really mean by that statement is - out of the 2560x1400 px of real estate available on the screen only 2560x700 px can be used by a window to show content. Why ? Because I have a dock at the bottom and a menu bar at the top which takes up some space vertically. So in this step you need to calculate that space. Here is how I did&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I personally used the <strong>⌘ + ⇧ + 4</strong> button to take a snapshot of the window and then see the resolution of the image file. So in my particular case I have the dock in the bottom so I need to compromise the height of the screen. Rounding off to the nearest integer the available real estate of a window comes out to be&nbsp;2560x1400.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>
Now you need to setup this custom resolution on your <span class="caps">VM</span>. So keep the VM on and run the following command on your&nbsp;terminal</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ VBoxManage controlvm [VM name] setvideomodehint [Width] [Height] 32</code></pre>
<p>For e.g. if you want to try this on a mac pro 13&quot;&nbsp;retina</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ VBoxManage controlvm Win7 setvideomodehint 2560 1400 32</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong>
This would be a really high resolution and you will not be able to read anything on the <span class="caps">VM</span> because the text would be really small. So now go to your VM with win7 installed and follow these steps&nbsp;- </p>
<ol>
<li>Open display&nbsp;settings.</li>
<li>Click on [Set custom size <span class="caps">DPI</span>] from the right hand side Navigation&nbsp;Bar.</li>
<li>Scale the font size to&nbsp;200%.</li>
<li>Click ok, Log off and Login&nbsp;again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila! you will definitely have a better Win7 experience on Mac&nbsp;now.</p>

Most of my free time is spent in front of the computer trying to think of solutions to problems in my pet projects. I have worked on .net, c#, Html, Javascript and node.js.</p>
<p>About this blog - It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information. I will also post information about my own projects or something that I am proud off.</p>
